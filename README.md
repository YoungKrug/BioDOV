# BioDOV
## Abstract

Expressing big data in a meaningful manner is exceptionally difficult. 
Scientists often struggle with the visualization of data due to several limitations. 
Currently, many scientists use two-dimensional figures to display and analyze meaningful data. 
However, I believe using game design theory and game technologies, we can create more robust visualizations.
These visualizations will allow scientists to easily communicate science to the masses 
and make better discoveries. Therefore, we introduce BioDOV (Biological Data Oriented 
Visualization). This tool will utilize game design principles to expand upon current 
visualization methods in the scientific community. Through this proof of concept, we will 
create the groundwork for better visualization technologies.
